*Chivalry* is a medieval-themed board game where players act as aspiring knights striving to bring honor to their families. Each gameplay element reflects a core value of knighthood—strength, wisdom, and charisma—translated visually through symbols and textures that build a consistent, immersive atmosphere.

My role focused on defining the **visual identity system**, including iconography, typography, and card illustration. The goal was to create a cohesive world that communicates the spirit of “chivalry” at first glance.

# Design Concept

To convey a sense of nobility and balance between realism and fantasy, I chose a **low-saturation brick-red palette** paired with metallic gradients and embossed surfaces.

The muted tone carries the warmth of aged parchment while keeping the visual atmosphere grounded. 

Metallic accents and embossed details add a quiet sense of prestige, echoing the shine of armor and the crafted textures of medieval design.

This color direction extends across the player board and rulebook: from the scoring panel, where color-coded elements distinguish each family’s identity, to the instruction layout that visually unifies all game components.

The result is a consistent world where every surface—cards, icons, and even rules—feels like part of the same knightly order.

# Visual System

## **Typography**

![chivalry-cover-transparent.png](%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F%20%E6%A1%8C%E4%B8%8A%E9%81%8A%E6%88%B2%EF%BC%9A%E9%A8%8E%E5%A3%AB%E7%B2%BE%E7%A5%9E/chivalry-cover-transparent.png)

The logotype draws inspiration from Gothic calligraphy—structured yet elegant. 

By embedding a sword motif through the letterforms and adding embossed highlights, the type becomes both a decorative and narrative element, embodying the “knight’s code.”

## Attribute Card

Each key ability—**Strength, Wisdom, and Charm**—was represented by its own emblem:

- **Sword** for power and courage
- **Book** for intellect and strategy
- **Rose** for charm and empathy

![chivalry-attribute-cards.png](%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F%20%E6%A1%8C%E4%B8%8A%E9%81%8A%E6%88%B2%EF%BC%9A%E9%A8%8E%E5%A3%AB%E7%B2%BE%E7%A5%9E/chivalry-attribute-cards.png)

![chivalry-attribute-card-hand.png](%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F%20%E6%A1%8C%E4%B8%8A%E9%81%8A%E6%88%B2%EF%BC%9A%E9%A8%8E%E5%A3%AB%E7%B2%BE%E7%A5%9E/chivalry-attribute-card-hand.png)

The shield-like frame unites them under one family crest, creating a sense of order and collectability across the cards.

## **Chivalry Cards**

Eight virtues define the path to victory. 

Each virtue was visualized with a unique icon and color theme to make its attribute immediately recognizable in gameplay. 

The icons follow a shared geometric rhythm, echoing heraldic symbols from medieval banners.

## **Player Boards**

Each of the five families is represented with its own **crest and color**, forming a distinctive visual identity while maintaining a consistent layout grid for cards and dice placement.

![chivalry-player-boards-2.png](%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F%20%E6%A1%8C%E4%B8%8A%E9%81%8A%E6%88%B2%EF%BC%9A%E9%A8%8E%E5%A3%AB%E7%B2%BE%E7%A5%9E/chivalry-player-boards-2.png)

## **Scoring Board**

![chivalry-scoring-board.png](%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F%20%E6%A1%8C%E4%B8%8A%E9%81%8A%E6%88%B2%EF%BC%9A%E9%A8%8E%E5%A3%AB%E7%B2%BE%E7%A5%9E/chivalry-scoring-board.png)

The scoring board tracks each knight’s progress throughout the game. 

Players earn points by fulfilling missions and demonstrating virtues, advancing their markers upward on the ladder. 

As points accumulate, the knight ascends in rank—visually and symbolically moving closer to achieving true chivalry.

## **Packaging Design**

![chivalry-packaging.jpg](%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F%20%E6%A1%8C%E4%B8%8A%E9%81%8A%E6%88%B2%EF%BC%9A%E9%A8%8E%E5%A3%AB%E7%B2%BE%E7%A5%9E/chivalry-packaging.jpg)

The outer box extends the game’s identity through **brick-red tones and embossed shield patterns**, creating tactile continuity from cards to box.

# Reflection

To keep the visual style consistent, I mapped out all components at the start to plan color and texture as one system.

Recreating a medieval look required careful study. I gathered references from manuscripts and heraldic designs to capture their essence and reinterpret them in a cleaner, modern way.

In the end, I learned that the groundwork—researching, organizing, and connecting details—is never the step to skip.
